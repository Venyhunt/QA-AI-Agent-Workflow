SRD → QA Test Case Automation (n8n + OpenAI)

 Overview
This project automates the generation of structured QA test cases from a Software Requirements Document (SRD/SRS) using n8n and OpenAI.

Instead of manually writing test cases, the workflow:
1. Reads an SRs (PDF)
2. Extracts requirement content
3. Uses OpenAI to generate structured test cases
4. Parses and validates JSON output
5. Exports formatted test cases to Excel (.xlsx)

 Architecture

SRS (PDF)  
→ Text Extraction  
→ OpenAI (Structured Test Case Generation)  
→ JSON Parsing (Code Node)  
→ Excel Export

 Tech Stack

- n8n (Self-hosted via Docker)
- Docker (Containerized local deployment with volume mounting)
- OpenAI API
- Excel (.xlsx) export
- GitHub for version control

 Philosophy

Built incrementally.  
Done > Perfect.  
Focused on automation architecture rather than prompt-only solutions.
